Ayos ang paggalaw ng price at pagte-trade, pero ano nga ba ang iba pang magagawa sa GHST, ang native token ng Aavegotchi?

Ang token ay dinisenyo na maging salapi ng Aavegotchi ecosystem para sa pagbili ng iba't-ibang on-chain assets sa laro. Kasama sa assets na ito ang Portals, wearables, consumables, collectibles, at iba pa. Bukod rito, may iba pang mga gamit ang GHST, tulad ng staking at voting power para sa DAO.

Lagyan mo ng laman ang bags mo, fren â€“ sa parte ng Wiki na 'to, susuriin natin nang malapitan ang makinang at purple na tokens ng laro.

## Why GHST
User incentives play a huge part in any project. In this case, GHST provides the economic incentives to encourage greater participation in the Aavegotchi ecosystem. Specifically, the token helps to align the respective goals of the AavegotchiDAO, GHST holders, and Aavegotchi holders.

Players have to buy GHST and spend it in the process of summoning and training Aavegotchis. A portion of this is transferred directly back to the DAO to continue funding the development of the ecosystem. At the same time, part of the value is also distributed as rewards for wise governance in the DAO, and as rewards for engaging in rarity farming.
