## The Aagent Missions


**THE AAVEGOTCHI MISSION PROGRAM IS NOW COMPLETE!**

Closing an epic chapter in Aavegotchi history, around 280 of our dedicated community members have made their way up through the ranks to official Aavegotchi Aagent status! These
agents will be the exclusive owners of the [Aavegotchi Aagent wearable set](/wearables#aagent-wearables-set), cementing their place in Aavegotchi lore. 

**CONGRATULATIONS AAGENTS!** <img src="/missions/tinyagent.png" alt = "aavegotchi agent">


From the aarchives:

<p style="font-size:25px; font-style: italic;"><b>"Your mission, should you choose to accept it..."</b></p>


Aavegotchi “missions” are a fun way to get a great understanding of the Aavegotchi project. Most are simple tasks (with the exception of just one
 that requires a bit more thought) and can be done whenever time permits and in any order you choose. As you complete each one, you’ll be leveled up 
by our Aaprentices, until you reach full Aagent status! Just be sure to hop in to Mission Control before mainnet launch, as our Aagent program will 
only run until then. Upon mainnet launch, Aagents who have **completed ALL Aavegotchi missions** will receive a **complete Aagent wearable set exclusively for Aavegotchi Aagents.**

**ALL 12 MISSIONS MUST BE COMPLETED BY 4 JANUARY 2021!**

[**MISSION 1:**](https://aavegotchi.medium.com/aavegotchi-community-update-3-4d733e8275e) Comment in the Aavegotchi Litepaper.

[**MISSION 2:**](https://aavegotchi.medium.com/aavegotchi-community-update-4-1744633c3fc4) Invite one fren to the Discord.

[**MISSION 3:**](https://aavegotchi.medium.com/aavegotchi-community-update-5-39d240b3bd13) Add a sentence or two of your thoughts about the project to the Aavegotchi Community Pitch paper.

[**MISSION 6:**](https://aavegotchi.medium.com/aavegotchi-community-update-8-8e2bcba353b9) Use our testnet to buy testnet (not real) GHST from the testnet bonding curve (which does NOT require KYC - the real bonding curve does, but **you can complete all missions without KYC).** This is where you’ll suddenly become an expert on using testnets if you haven’t before, and will feel super smart helping everyone who comes after you. If you get stuck on Mission 6, ask us! We're happy to aassist our Aagents.

Publish your creation on the platform you choose (there are several options available for each), and retweet us one more time along with your link to your aavesome Aavegotchi content.

## Share2Earn Litepaper Campaign

We’re partnering with Viral Loops, an industry leader in referral programs, to create a limited-time campaign where you can earn real rewards for referring your frens to learn about Aavegotchi.

The focus of this campaign will be on spreading awareness about the Aavegotchi Realm Litepaper, and the primary rewards will be [Drop Tickets](/metaverse#drop-tickets), a new special type Raffle Ticket that we’ve created for NFT drops.

**Here’s how to participate**:

1. Take the Aavegotchi Realm Litepaper quiz [here](https://gotchigang.typeform.com/to/gYuY3bxN#referralcode=MU92ddy). Just for passing this short quiz and verifying your email, you’ll earn 1 Rare Ticket NFT. Rare Tickets can be entered into future Wearable Raffles (but not Portal and REALM Raffles).

2. Join the #Share2Earn Program. After completing the quiz, you’ll receive an email that lets you opt into the Referral Program, so you can start inviting your frens. You’ll earn another Rare Ticket by inviting the first fren.

3. Now the fun begins! Keep inviting frens to start earning Drop Tickets! You’ll earn more tickets every time you reach a Milestone.
