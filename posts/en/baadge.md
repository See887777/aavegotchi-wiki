Aavegotchi Baadges are non-transferable ERC-1155 NFTs that commemorate your Gotchi's participation in a special event. Once a Baadge is sent to your Gotchi, it resides in their [Gotchi Pocket](/aavegotchi-profile#gotchi-pocket) forever.

Baadges could be earned in a variety of ways:

* Getting into the Top 10/100 for Rarity Farming
* Participating in an event
* Voting in a major AavegotchiDAO vote
* Breaking a mini-game's high score
* .....And many more!

Keep your eyes out for more Baadges. They will be announced by the team as and when they become available.
