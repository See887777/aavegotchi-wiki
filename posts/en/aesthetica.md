Aesthetica are aesthetic NFTs that can be added to a Parcel, but do not affect its [Alchemica](/gotchus-alchemica) or other statistics. They just look dope.

## ROFL Gnome


In real life, Gnomes watch over crops and livestock. In the Gotchiverse, ROFL Gnomes watch over Alchemica and Installations. They’re also said to bring good luck, so maybe try installing one to see if it helps your Alchemica reserves once it comes time to survey your parcel. Whether it does so or not, the ROFL Gnome is a must have for any serious Gotchi decoration connoisseur.

## REALM Globe

Aavegotchis travel far and wide, exploring the deepest corners of the Gotchiverse, participating in quests, and working together with frens. As such, the REALM Globe is a symbol of both travel and co-existence with fellow Gotchi-Kin. Winning a REALM Globe during the first Decorations Raffle could mean the world to some members of GotchiGang, or should we say it could mean the Gotchiverse.

## Smol Flower

The Gotchiverse is rich with bright Alchemica rivers, magnificent landmarks, and flashy designs. How do you encapsulate all of this beauty onto one Gotchiverse Realm parcel? With a decorative Smol Flower of course! Win a few and you can even become the Gotchiverse’s first gardener.

## Laava Lamp

In the Gotchiverse, rituals are important. In fact your Gotchi prefers to engage in a solo Alchemical Channeling ritual once each day. When the Lodge comes online, having your frens over for a Communal Channeling sesh can lead to even higher yields. Regardless of which type of ritual you engage in, it’s important to set the mood. This groovy Laava Lamp will do just that, setting the perfect vibe for any channeling sesh, solo or communal.

## Neon Light

For GotchiGang, “GM” isn’t just something we say, it’s a way of life. I mean clearly, we didn’t top the [Discord GM Index](https://mirror.xyz/danielpartida.eth/VkvuHM4TM-RM0_eCxZTn8rM7aGPUrzE-mmc0lqNPZ3Q) for no reason. Now you can light up your Gotchiverse REALM parcel with a frenly Neon “GM” Light for all to see. Who knows, these bright lights may even help us top a future metaverse GM Index!

## Caamp Fire

Picture this: your Gotchi just got done with a long day of farming, channeling, and warding off Lickquidators. They’re tired, and their HP has dropped significantly. They finally make it back to the comfort of their parcel and just want to relax, count their Alchemica, and feel loved. The perfect spot for them to do so? Around a warm Caampfire of course!
