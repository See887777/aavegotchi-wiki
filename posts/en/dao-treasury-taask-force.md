The DAO Treasury Taask Force (DTF) is a committee assigned with making [DAO](/dao) treasury management proposals to the community and DAO for consideration.

The initial mission and goals of the committee will be:

1. Grow and optimize the DAO treasury with an emphasis on safety, security and transparency

2. Partner with Pixelcraft to assist in developing and identifying tools and infrastructure for ongoing DAO Treasury management

3. Foster and encourage growth of the overall Aavegotchi community by increasing awareness, actively promoting adoption, and maintaining current user engagement.

## Origins


On Oct 2021, Dr Wagmi proposed the idea of a DTF on a [forum post](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/establish-the-dao-treasury-taask-force/2460).

This was formalized in a [DAO vote / AGIP 20](/aavegotchi-improvement-proposals#creating-the-dao-treasury-taask-force). The vote passed and the DTF was created with 8 members.

Subsequently, another [DAO vote / AGIP 28](/aavegotchi-improvement-proposals#extending-the-dao-treasury-task-force-multisig) was proposed by [Coderdan](/team#coder-dan) to expand the DTF multisig. The vote passed, increasing the size of the DTF to 18 members.
